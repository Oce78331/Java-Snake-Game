# 🐍 Java Snake Game

A classic Snake game built in Java using basic GUI components. This project is a great starting point for learning about game development, event-driven programming, and simple graphics in Java.

## 🎮 Game Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows
- Simple but clean UI
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- Score tracking

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java (JDK 8+)
- Swing (for GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-snake-game.git
   cd java-snake-game

2. **Compile the game:**

   bash
   javac SnakeGame.java
   

3. **Run the game:**

   bash
   java SnakeGame
   

   > Make sure all `.java` files are in the same directory when compiling.

## 🎮 Controls

* **Arrow Keys** – Move the snake
* **P** – Pause/Unpause the game
* **R** – Restart the game (if implemented)

## 🧠 How It Works

* The snake moves continuously in one direction.
* Eating food increases the snake's length and score.
* Collision with walls or itself ends the game.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add sound effects and background music
* Implement a high-score system
* Add different levels or modes (e.g., speed boost, walls)
* Mobile or web port using other technologies
